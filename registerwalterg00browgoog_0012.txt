INTRODUCTION.

 

 

IN 1872, the Register of Walter Gray, Archbishop
of York, 121 5-12 5 5, appeared as one of the publica-

317) has given a very full account of the life of this
prelate, to which the editor of this volume can add
little, and as Giffard had no special connection with
the Northern Province previous to his translation to
York, it will be more convenient, with a view to
save room, to give merely a brief outline of the earlier
portion of his career, and to devote the space thus
gained to a study of the more important matters
referred to in his register.

Walter Giffard was the son, probably the eldest
son,of Hugh Giffard of Boyton, in Wiltshire, a man

coheiress of Walter de Cormeilles. Except that he
