interesting to find out how this disagreement
between the Pope's licence and the law of the realm
was settled. The churches of Skipwith, Fishlake,

Felixkirk, and High Hoyland¹ were all held by
aliens (Nos 357, 606, 649, 901).

Even with the officials of native birth the arch-
bishop had some difficulty in maintaining friendly
relations, His chancellor, William Wickwane‚ who
afterwards succeeded him in the archbishopriC‚ -
accused him of encroaching upon his rights and
robbing him of certain fees pertaining to his office
(No. ¹4 5). With the Archdeacon of Cleveland,
who was a foreigner, as is mentioned above, it was
not to be expected that his relations would be
cordial. According to the archbishop’s statement
(No. 351), the archdeacon treated him very ungrate-
fully. He had always been the archdeacon's friend,
and he was astonished to find him accusing him
to the Pope. Although this friction existed between
them, the archbishop attached great weight to the
archdeacon’s opinion, and in one case, wrote a
special letter to ask his advice on a matter of
difficulty (N ο. 650). The most troublesome dignitary
with whom Giffard had to deal was the Archdeacon
of Nottingham, Thomas de Wyten, who had to
be publicly admonished to be obedient (No, 43).

Money difficulties were amongst the most pressing
of the troubles by which the archbishop was
