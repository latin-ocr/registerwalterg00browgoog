Guilford to Churchdown (No. 458). His affection
for her was so great that even her nurse shared in
his largesse (No. 503). His nepheWS, Hugh de
Babington and Robert de Escote, who was probably
a son of Lady L. de Escote, to whom the archbishop
made a present of 1008. (No, 458), were appointed
to positions of trust about his person (Nos, 501, 850,
396). His method of providing for his brother
Godfrey‚ by appointing him to the archdeaconry
of Cleveland, has been already mentioned.¹ The
relative whose later career best justified the arch-
bishop’s generosity was William of Greenfield‚
who occupied the See of York, 1304-1315. Canon
Raine in his Fasti Eboracenses (p. 362) states that
Greenfield was connected with the Giffard family,
but does not give the exact relationship. The
archbishop seems to have defrayed his expenses
at Oxford, whither he had already gone in the
summer of 1269 (No. 490), and where he still was
in the November of the following year (No. 503).
To enable his relative to maintain himself in a
suitable manner he conferred on him a prebend in
Southwell Minster‚ on Dec. 29, 1269 (No, 353),
which he resigned for one in Ripon in 1272 (No, 259),
This last he still possessed at the end of 1275 (No,
838), the latest mention of his name in this register.
Another future archbishop, Master John le Romeyn,
participated in his bounty, receiving a sum of 13li.

brother, William Giflard‚ who was sister, Mabel, who was successively
sherifl of Norfolk and Suflolk. 54 abbess of Elstow and Shaftesbury‚
