porary hand. At the commencement is a brief
index written on paper‚ compiled by the antiquary
Torre, towards the close of the seventeenth century.
To him also is due the pagination throughout. Till
last year the register was encased in a slight
parchment cover, but it is now substantially bound
in half Morocco by Messrs, Eyre and Spottiswoode‚
bookbinders to the British Museum‚ and the
manuscript has thus been rendered secure from
injury. The volume is divided into two portiom,
the second commencing at p. 253. It had originally

have been printed elsewhere, or those which relate
to local affairs or persons, which have already
