Dei nomine, Amen. Dum ad defensionem libertatum
ecclesiae divina providentia nos duxerit invitandos adversus
eos qui in propriae matris ruinam modestiam frenant et
laxant audaciam delinquendi, ut, per medicinalem com-
munionis subtractionem, tam pena ruboris et dampni quam
premio meritorum ab oppressione ecclesiae arceantur;

Sancti]‚ ac gloriosae Virginis Mariae‚ et beatorum Petri et
Pauli, Apostolorum ejuS, [beati Thomae Martiris, S. Edwardi,
regis et confessoris], necnon sacrosanctae Apostolicae Sedis
et nostra, [ex habundanti cautela] hortamur, precipimus et
monemus ut perturbatores libertatum ecclesiae, [pacis et
tranquillitatis domini regis et regni, insuper votorum
crucesi atorum et peregrinationis in subsidium Terrae
Sanctae , raptores et depredatores bonorum Deo dedica-
torum et ecclesiasticorum quorumlibet. . . . .
